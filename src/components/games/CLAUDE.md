# Game Components Directory

## Current Status - UPDATED ✅

**✅ EXTRACTION COMPLETE: Games successfully modularized!**

All working games have been successfully extracted from the monolithic `src/RetroGameToolbox.jsx` file into individual component files. The extraction preserved all functionality including particle effects, sound integration, and enhanced features.

### Component Status

#### ✅ **Fully Implemented & Extracted Games**
- **SnakeGame.jsx** - ✅ Complete with power-ups, lives system, particle effects, touch/keyboard controls
- **PongGame.jsx** - ✅ AI opponent, difficulty scaling, enhanced physics, particle effects  
- **BreakoutGame.jsx** - ✅ Multi-hit bricks, power-ups, level progression, advanced collision detection

#### ❌ **Games Needing Implementation** 
- **TetrisGame.jsx** - ❌ Placeholder - needs full Tetris implementation
- **SpaceInvadersGame.jsx** - ❌ Placeholder - needs full Space Invaders implementation

## What Needs to Be Done

### Phase 1: Implement Missing Games
Priority order for implementing remaining games:

1. **Tetris Game** - High Priority
   - Implement falling tetromino pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L shapes)
   - Add piece rotation and movement logic  
   - Implement line clearing when rows are complete
   - Add scoring system and level progression
   - Include particle effects for line clears
   - Integrate with existing sound system
   - Add touch controls for mobile

2. **Space Invaders Game** - High Priority  
   - Implement player ship movement and shooting
   - Create enemy formation with movement patterns
   - Add collision detection for bullets vs enemies/player
   - Implement power-ups and weapon upgrades
   - Add particle effects for explosions
   - Include sound effects and background music
   - Progressive difficulty with waves

### Phase 2: Testing & Polish
- ✅ Test extracted Snake, Pong, Breakout games
- ❌ Test new Tetris implementation
- ❌ Test new Space Invaders implementation
- ❌ Cross-platform testing (desktop, mobile, touch)
- ❌ Performance optimization
- ❌ Visual polish and particle effect tuning

## Architecture Notes

### Extracted Game Pattern
Each extracted game follows this pattern:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from 'react';
import { /* Lucide icons */ } from 'lucide-react';
import { SoundManager } from '../../core/SoundManager';
import { Particle } from '../../core/ParticleSystem';

export const GameName = ({ settings, updateHighScore }) => {
  // Game state using hooks
  // Canvas setup and game loop
  // Input handling (keyboard, mouse, touch)
  // UI components (score, controls, game over)
  return (/* JSX */);
};
```

### Shared Systems
- **SoundManager** (`src/core/SoundManager.ts`) - Web Audio API sound effects
- **ParticleSystem** (`src/core/ParticleSystem.ts`) - Visual effects system
- **GameTypes** (`src/core/GameTypes.ts`) - TypeScript interfaces
- **Settings & Stats hooks** - Persistent user preferences and high scores

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow the established pattern from extracted games
2. Use the shared ParticleSystem for visual effects
3. Integrate with SoundManager for audio feedback
4. Support multiple input methods (keyboard, mouse, touch)
5. Include pause/resume and restart functionality
6. Implement responsive canvas sizing
7. Add proper TypeScript types if using .tsx files

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Snake game fully functional after extraction
- [ ] Pong game fully functional after extraction  
- [ ] Breakout game fully functional after extraction
- [ ] Tetris game implementation (when complete)
- [ ] Space Invaders game implementation (when complete)
- [ ] All games work on mobile devices
- [ ] Sound effects work in all games
- [ ] High scores save correctly
- [ ] Settings persist across games
- [ ] Build process works correctly
- [ ] Server deployment works

## Development Workflow
1. Test extracted games to ensure functionality is preserved
2. Implement Tetris following the established pattern
3. Implement Space Invaders following the established pattern  
4. Test all games thoroughly
5. Add any missing polish or features
6. Update this documentation as needed
